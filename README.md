This is a React/Redux project of netflix-like app to browse through movies.
It calls API, shows some info about currently  most popular movies, let the user add some movies to his private favorite list,the user can search for a movie title or a movie genre and browse the results.
This is the first version of the app, obviously we can add more functionalities to it. I wanted to concentrate on Redux and API calls here. The movie database I used is not huge, but it is enough to show the functionalities.
